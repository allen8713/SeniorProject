# A Programmable Pressure Cuff at Fingertip to Aid Sepsis Detection in Intensive Care Unit
Sepsis is an infectious disease with a very high
fatality rate. In Taiwan, the fatality rate is as high as nearly 30%.
Sepsis is also known as the "silent killer" due to its vague
symptoms difficult to be discerned. Therefore, early detection of
sepsis is highly desired. Its systemic inflammation may cause
thrombosis and reduce the peripheral blood flow. By delivering
a standardized pressure at the fingertip, the blood refill time can
be used to detect the reduction of blood flow, which is an
indicator of potential sepsis. In this preliminary study we
designed a programmable light pressure cuff applicable to the
same fingertip when the finger probe of pulse oximetry is also
worn. Its functionality and durability were validated. Eventually
the inexpensive device can be applied to each patient in the ICU
to monitor sepsis from real-time pulse signal analysis under a
cloud-computing architecture.
